# palioGarage

This project is a work-in-progress use case that highlights modern full stack web development practices and technologies. This project is intended to evolve as I explore and enhance my understanding of the framework.

## Idea

The palio project is an idea for a website aimed at Fiat owners, focusing on the maintenance and repair of their Palio Weekend vehicles. As a car enthusiast and a Fiat Palio owner, I appreciate the value of having a collection of instructions and tips, especially since finding resources in English can be tough.

I plan to start the project with basic HTML to refresh my coding skills and gradually incorporate more advanced technologies. I envision using React for the user forum, Node.js and MongoDB for the online store, i18next for bilingual support, and offering downloadable PDF guides.

Ultimately, my goal is to create a valuable resource that helps fellow Fiat Palio owners with their vehicle maintenance while I continue my journey of learning to code.
